       This was a memorable bootcamp by Shape AI.The classes were taken by Shaurya Sinha.
       It was a 7 day bootcamp.It dealt with the basics of javascript,HTML and react.js. 
       It required no prerequisties and I was able to understand all the  basics of these many languages.
       Thank you Shape AI for this amazing bootcamp and I expect many more such classes from Shape AI.
